%% This script generates a visualization showing how bursts are detected.
%  It shows two steps:
%   1. Calculation of distribution of neuron ISIs, from which we can
%   determine a threshold ISI. Consectuive spikes with ISIs below the
%   threshold ISI are considred bursts. 
%   2. Plots showing the thresholding process descrbied in (1).


% Setup some parameters for the burst detection algorithm.
