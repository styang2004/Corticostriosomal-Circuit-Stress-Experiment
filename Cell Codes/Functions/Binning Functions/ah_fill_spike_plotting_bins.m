%AH_FILL_SPIKE_PLOTTING_BINS creates bins that can be plotted by either
%ah_double_aligned_population_analysis or ah_plot_maze (both versions).
%Once data has been extracted from twdb in the appropriate form, this
%function allows us to convert it into a plottable form. This function is
%specifically for plotting spikes; use ah_fill_burst_plotting_bins for the
%equivalent function that works on bursts. Inputs are:
% LARGE_SPIKES_ARRAY - a cell array where each entry is a list of the
%   spikes within a given window in that trial. Trials must be in order
%   within their neuron, and clumped together with trials for neuron 1
%   ahead of trials for neuron 2 if and only if neuron 1 is indexed before
%   neuron 2. Otherwise this function won't work and might run into errors.
% SES_EVT_TIMINGS - a cell array where each entry is an array of the
%   timings of all the events we care about for each trial. Also includes
%   the event number so that we can distinguish between such things as left
%   decision versus right decision and chocolate decision versus mixture
%   decision.
% NEURON_IDSaNDdATA - an array with a row for each neuron containing
%   pertinent information: the index of the session it belongs to, the
%   index of the last trial in large_spikes_array belonging to that neuron,
%   and various properties of the neuron as needed for both this function
%   and its equivalent with bursts (baseline data/firing rates)
% SELECTION_CRITERIA - a cell array with selection criteria for trials
%   pertaining to events which might or might have occured. Each entry
%   first lists the column number of the ses_evt_timings of the current
%   session and afterwards the event IDs of the allowable events. This
%   allows us to select, for instance, only chocolate trials or only
%   mixture trials. If unspecified, then by assumption all trials are used
%   and variable initialized as empty cell.
if ~exist('selection_criteria')
    selection_criteria = {};
end
% SELECTED_TRIALS - a cell array that allows us to select exactly which
%   trials of each neuron we wish to include. Can also be used to deselect
%   full neurons if in the appropriate index we have an array full of
%   zeros. Each entry is an array of zeros or ones; if the array is not as
%   long as the number of trials, all additional trials are considered
%   selected. If cell array is not long enough, all trials of additional
%   neurons are considered selected. If not given as an input, this
%   variable is initialized as an empty cell (all trials selected)
if ~exist('selected_trials', 'var')
    selected_trials = {};
end
% PLOTTING_PARAMETERS - 5 parameters pertaining to how we fill/define the
%   bins and thus how we plot. The entries are, in order, as follows:
%       - the number of bins to plot
%       - the index in the events array of our first alignment event
%       - the index in the events array of our second alignment event
%       - the location (on a scale of 0 to 1) where we want our first event
%           to fall. This helps us define explicitly our bins
%       - the location (on a scale of 0 to 1) where we want our second
%           event to fall. This helps us explicitly define our bins.
%   If not given as an input, variable is initialized as [200, 1, 2, .3,
%   .6] which specifies: 200 bins, first alignment event is (usually)
%   click, second alignment event is (usually) lick, with click located 30%
%   of the way through the bins, and lick 60 (e.g. click at bin 60 and
%   lick at bin 120)
if ~exist('plotting_parameters', 'var')
    plotting_parameters = [200, 1, 2, .3, .6];
end
% NORMALIZATION_TYPE - A marker indicating the type of normalization we
%   wish to use. See comments below for types of normalization. If not
%   specified, variable will be initialized as [0 0] (raw data, not
%   normalized). Second entry determines whether we are doing a trial by
%   trial or neuron by neuron type of analysis.
if ~exist('normalization_type', 'var')
    normalization_type = [0 0];
end
% KEEP_ALL_DATA - A marker indicating whether we wish to keep all the data
% on a trial by trial/neuron by neuron level. Not for general use; creates
% a giant array.
if ~exist('keep_allData', 'var')
    keep_allData = 0;
