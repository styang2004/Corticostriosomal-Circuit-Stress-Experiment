function ah_injectDataIntoTWDB(base_twdbfile, new_twdbfile, laser)
%AH_INJECTDATAINTOTWDB injects, for all neurons in base_twdbfile (except
%for those that could cause errors), various data relevant to the
%burst-based and spike-based analysis, and saves the new twdb file as
%new_twdbfile. Note that it is CRUCIAL that we preserve a base twdbfile -
%for the sake of debugging and such it might be necessary to recreate the
%twdbfile again and again, and it always should be built from the base
%twdbfile to avoid (1) errors (2) confusion and (3) giant twdbfiles (as it
%is, the data being injected takes up a lot of space). Inputs are
%self-explanatory; this function has no outputs, it merely saves the new
%twdbfile in the specified location.
% Laser input tells functions whether or not this is a laser TWDB file, and
% that we should look for the post laser block.
