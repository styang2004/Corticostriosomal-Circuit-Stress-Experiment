%AH_BUILD_SPIKES_ARRAY creates a cell array of spike times for each trial,
%in a given window about some alignment event. Also computes the mean
%firing rate and an approximation of the standard deviation of
%the firing rate.
%Inputs are:
% SPIKES - sorted array of times of every spike recorded at the given
%   neuron in the given session.
% EVENTS - sorted two column array of every event occuring in the session
%   and its timing
% ALIGNMENT_EVENT - the event we are aligning all spikes to
% WINDOW - the window about the event in which we wish to record all spikes
% TRIAL_MARKER - the event we use as the start of each trial (e.g. end of
%   baseline event)
% NUMBINS - number of bins we are using for computation of standard
%   deviation firing rate. If not specified, initialized as 40.
