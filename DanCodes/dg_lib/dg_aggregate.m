function [nums, cells] = dg_aggregate(nums, cells, cols)
%DG_AGGREGATE a cell array according to the contents of a descriptive
%numeric array.
%[nums, cells] = dg_aggregate(nums, cells, cols)

% <nums> is a numerical array, <cells> is a cell array with the same number
% of rows as <nums>.  Finds rows of <nums> that are identical in all
% columns *except* those listed in <cols>, removes them, and replaces them
% with a single row having NaN in columns <cols>.  Does a parallel removal
% of the same rows from <cells> that were removed from <nums>, and replaces
% them with a single row, each of whose elements is the vertical
% concatenation of the cell contents from the same column of the removed
% rows. This implies that the contents of the cells must be vertically
% concatenable.
