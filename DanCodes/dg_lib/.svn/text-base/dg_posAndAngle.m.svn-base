function [x, y, theta] = dg_posAndAngle(targ, colors)
%INPUT
% <targ> is a targets array as returned by Nlx2MatVT_v3.
% <colors> is optional; default is to ignore target colors.
% GOOD INTENTIONS - NOT IMPLEMENTED
% If <colors> is
% given, it is a 2 x 3 bit array where the first row represents the color
% of the LED on the animal's left, and the second row is the color on the
% right.
%OUTPUTS
% All the outputs are column vectors of length size(targ,2).
% <x>, <y> are the positions of the midpoint of the first two targets as
% recorded in <targ>.  theta is the angle in radians of the two targets
% with respect to vertical (12 o'clock), positive to the left
% (counter-clockwise).  Thus theta is the angle with respect to the
% horizontal (standard engineering representation) of the rat's head
% direction when the LEDs are mounted to the left and right of the
% headstage.  Note that if <colors> is not specified, then <theta> ranges
% only -pi/2 to +pi/2, whereas if <colors> is given, <theta> ranges from
% -pi to +pi.
