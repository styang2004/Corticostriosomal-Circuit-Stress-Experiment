function dg_rbcolormapdemo
% This is a demonstration of the red-blue colormap contained in
% 'dg_rbcolormap.mat'.  'dg_rbcolormap.mat' contains just one variable
% named 'rbcolormap'.  It is a 64-color colormap useful for creating
% pseudocolor images (e.g. using 'imagesc') that look similar both to
% trichromats and to red-green colorblind people.  It prints well in native
% RGB color mode and when transformed to CMYK color mode. The resolution of
% extreme values is ever so slightly better in RGB mode when printed.
