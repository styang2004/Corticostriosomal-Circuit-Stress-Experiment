function [canonicalstamps, activefnums] = dg_reconcileFrames(timestamps)
% When Cheetah recording stops, it sometimes happens that some channels
% record one frame more than the other channels.  Rodent data may contain
% many starts and stops, so there can be frame discrepancies in the middles
% of files.  We make the files uniform by deleting the extra frames
% wherever they occur.
%INPUT
% timestamps - a cell vector containing the list of timestamps from all the
% files that are to be reconciled.  May also contain empty cells, which are
% ignored.
%OUTPUTS
% canonicalstamps - the list of timestamps common to all files.
% activefnums - the equivalent of lfp_ActiveFilenums for the current
%   value of <timestamps>, i.e. a list of indices of non-empty cells in
%   <timestamps>.
