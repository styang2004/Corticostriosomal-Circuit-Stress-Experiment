function [P, freqs, wt] = dg_morletgram(x, dt, fspacing, freqlim, param)
%INPUTS
% x: time series vector.
% dt: sample period.
% fspacing: ratio between scales on successive rows.
% freqlim: two-element vector where freqlim(1) is the the pseudo-frequency
%   of the longest scale and freqlim(2) is a limit which will not be
%   exceeded by the pseudo-frequency of the shortest scale.
% param: optional argument to specify the Morlet wavelet width parameter.
%   This is approximately the number of cycles in the wavelet. Default = 6.
%   Values below about 4 or 5 are considered dangerous, whereas above about
%   15 they become boring.
%OUTPUTS
% P: pseudo-power, i.e. the squared magnitude of <wt.cfs>.
% freqs: vector of pseudo-frequency values corresponding to the scale on
%   each row of <wt>.
% wt: the complex continuous wavelet transform of <x>, as returned by
%   cwtft.
