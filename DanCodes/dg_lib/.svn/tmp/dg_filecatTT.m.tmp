function [offset, nrec1] = dg_filecatTT(infiles, outfile)
%dg_filecatTT(infiles, outfile) concatenates the contents of two
% Neuralynx TT input files to a Neuralynx TT output file.  Stupidly uses
% the first file's header as the header for the output file, does not check
% for consistency of contents.  Adds a temporal offset to all timestamps in
% the second file sufficient so that the first timestamp in the second file
% is greater than the last timestamp in the first file (it is assumed that
% the timestamps are in ascending order).
% INPUTS
%   infiles: a cell array of strings, each of which points to a file to be
%       read and copied to the output.
%   outfile: a string that points to the destination file to which output
% OUTPUTS
%   offset: the temporal offset of the second file, expressed in the
%       units of the timestamps in the input files.
%   nrec1: the number of records in the first file.
