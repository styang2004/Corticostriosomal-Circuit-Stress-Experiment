function result = dg_mapfunc(fhandle, varargin)
% result = dg_mapfunc(fhandle, arg1, arg2, ...)
%The function denoted by <fhandle> must take as many arguments as are
%provided after <fhandle>; at least one argument must be provided. All args
%must be of the same size, and all must be cell arrays. The result is a
%cell array of the same size as the args, such that element j is the result
%of applying <fhandle> to element j of each of the arguments.
