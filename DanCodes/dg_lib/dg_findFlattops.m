% This is a variation on dg_findPeaks which is tolerant of flat tops on the
% peaks.  The definition of a peak is thus extended to include any series
% of samples in which the first is strictly less than the second and the
% last is strictly less than the second to last, and all internal samples
% are equal.
%INPUTS
% samples: a vector of time series values.
% thresh1: optional argument.  If given, then the value of the internal
%   samples must be strictly greater than <thresh1>.
% thresh2: optional argument.  If given, then the internal samples must be
%   strictly less than <thresh2>.
%OUTPUTS
% vmaxidx: index into <samples> of the first sample of each (potentially
%   flat-topped) peak.  Flat-topped peaks are indicated by
%   ismember(vmaxidx, runidx).
% runidx: index into <samples> of the first index in each flat run, not
%   including runs that start at the first sample or end on the last
%   sample.
% endrunidx:  index into <samples> of the last index in each flat run, not
%   including runs that start at the first sample or end on the last
%   sample.
%NOTES
% The strategy here is to find all consecutive runs of equal-valued samples
% in <samples> that are greater than <thresh1> and condense them down to a
% single sample.  The resulting de-flat-topped time series is then
% submitted to dg_findPeaks, and the results are converted back to the
% original index space.
