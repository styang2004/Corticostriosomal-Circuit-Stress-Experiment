function cmap = dg_colorspiral(N, hstep, slim, vlim)
% Produces a colormap of N colors that traverses a spiral (sort of) in the
% HSV color space.  Hue varies by successive increments of <hstep>, but is
% interpreted mod 1.
% Saturation alternates between slim(1) and slim(2) with each wrap around
% the hue circle. Value ramps from svlim(1) to svlim(2).

% To get hue values to repeat every kth wrap, use n*hstep - k = hstep, i.e.
% hstep = k/(n-1) where n is any integer s.t. (n-1) has no factors in
% common with k.

% Practically speaking, it's hard to get more than about 100
% distinguishable colors or 64 readily distinguishable colors.  However,
% this is a significant improvement over jet(64), whose colors are NOT
% readily distinguishable.
