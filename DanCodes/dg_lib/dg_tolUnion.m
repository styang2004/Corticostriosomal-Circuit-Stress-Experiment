function result = dg_tolUnion(A, B, tol)
%result = dg_tolUnion(A, B, tol)
%   Returns the same result as union(A,B,'rows') except that values of
%   A(:,end) and B(:,end) that differ by less than tol are considered to
%   be equal, and all members of clusters of values where nearest neighbors
%   differ by less than tol are also considered equal.  Note that if tol =
%   0, then no duplicates are eliminated.
