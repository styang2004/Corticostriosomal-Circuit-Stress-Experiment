%dg_ComputePerTrial Computes various measures per trial over specified time
%segments.
% result = dg_ComputePerTrial(measure, segspecs, trialdata, ...
%    clusternum, condition)
% Returns a matrix containing an element for each time segment specification 
% in segspecs computed for each trial in trialdata.  
%
% measure: is a string that may have one of these values, used to control
%   what measure will be computed:
%       'duration'
%           Seconds.  Simply (stop-start).  clusternum is ignored.
%       'rate'
%           Spikes per second.  
%       'spikes'
%           Raw spike count.  The criterion for including a spike is 
%           (start < timestamp <= stop).
% segspecs: should be an
%   array of structures of the type returned by dg_ParseSegmentSpec.  The
%   offsets are assumed to be in mS.
% trialdata:  should be an array of trialdata of the type returned by
%   dg_ReadMouseFormat.  result(m,n) will contain the result for
%   trialdata(m) computed over segspecs(n), or NaN if an error was
%   encountered during  computation.  
% clusternum: is the ID number of the cluster in the
%   trialdata for which result will be computed.  
% condition: is a string which,
%   when evaluated by eval in the context of the innermost loop, must yield
%   a true result, or else the result will be reported as NaN and a warning
%   raised.  (See dg_ParseSelectionSpec, which returns such a string.  Note
%   that this whole mechanism is kludgy and should be replaced by a
%   recursive data structure and matching interpreter.)
% Note that event TTL ID 1 is treated as special, because it is the "Disc
% On" ("Start Recording") event, and therefore always is implicitly present
% and has timestamp 0, whereas for other events a 0 timestamp means that
% the event did not occur.
