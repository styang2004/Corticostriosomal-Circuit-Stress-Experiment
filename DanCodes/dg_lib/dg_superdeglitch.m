function samples = dg_superdeglitch(samples, thresh, maxpts)
%samples = dg_superdeglitch(samples, thresh, maxpts)
%INPUTS
% samples: sample data of any size or shape.
% thresh: minimum departure from previous value that qualifies as a glitch.
% maxpts: the maximum number of points that can qualify as a glitch and
%   thus get interpolated away.
%OUTPUT
%NOTES
%  Returns the same sample data that was passed in, modified by linearly
%  interpolating glitches.  A k-point glitch is defined as a series of k
%  points that differ from a preceding point "a" by more than <thresh>, but
%  which is followed by a point "b" that differs from the predecessor point
%  "a" by less than or equal to <thresh>. It is explicitly NOT required
%  that the k members of the k-point glitch be within <thresh> of each
%  other, only that they be more than <thresh> from "a".  This makes it
%  possible to remove random noise bursts.  The interpolation extends from
%  the last point before the glitch through (including) the first point
%  after the glitch, so all glitch points get replaced by the
%  interpolation.
%   NaN values do not qualify as glitches, but they also don't
%  qualify as endpoints of a sequence to interpolate, and will prevent any
%  glitches that contain them from being removed.
%   This version has been completely rewritten to use less memory.
%  However, it does still have some memory issues, to wit:  the amount of
%  additional memory it requires is about twice the size of <samples>,
%  which means that the amount of memory allocated to the Matlab running it
%  will be at least three times the size of <samples> plus the size of a
%  freshly started Matlab (which is usually around 2 GB).
