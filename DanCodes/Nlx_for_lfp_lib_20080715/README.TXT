Checked the following names in this directory (all of them as of 8/17/2004),
and there are no conflicts with the names in C:\MATLAB6p5\work\Nlx2MatV3 or
C:\MATLAB6p5\work\Mat2NlxFileCreators:
Nlx2MatEV
Nlx2MatCSC
Nlx2MatSE

Nlx2MatTT, Mat2NlxTT are used in dg_lib.
NOTE:  it seems that every time I copy a Nlx header using Nlx2MatTT, Mat2NlxTT
I get yet another empty string appended to it.

4/2/2007:  added Mat2NlxEV, which was used all along by dg_makeDummyCSC.
Ditto for Mat2NlxCSC.
Also added Mat2NlxEV2004, which I renamed from Mat2NlxFileCreators\Mat2NlxEV.
Mat2NlxEV2004 is used by dg_writeNlxEvents.
