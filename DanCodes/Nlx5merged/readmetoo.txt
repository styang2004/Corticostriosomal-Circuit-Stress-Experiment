Given that the unix functions empirically seem to number records
starting at 0, I infer that the '_v3' suffix on the file names
indicates the source code of version 3 was used.  Sooner or later,
there will be a bug that only exists on unix systems, because they
do fix bugs from time to time at Neuralynx in the Windows version,
whereas the unix version is effectively frozen at v3 (subject to the
whims of Ueli Rutishauser, who hopefully maintains it).  See
http://www.urut.ch/new/serendipity/index.php?/pages/downloads.html.

Note that
the other release notes files are 'README' (for unix) and
'ReleaseNotes.txt' (for Windows).
